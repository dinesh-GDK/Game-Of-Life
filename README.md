# Conway's Game Of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The world of Game of life is typically a two-dimentional infinitely long plane. But in this application we are restricted to the size of the screen. This plane is divided into small square cells with  each of them in two possible states, **live** or **dead**.

The rules of **Game of Life** are:
- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbouring cells dies (underpopulation)
- A live cell with more than three live neighbouring cells dies (overpopulation)
- A live cell with two or three live neighbouring survives
- A dead cell with three neighbourig cells becomes a live cell (reproduction)
